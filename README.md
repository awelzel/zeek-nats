Zeek NATS log writer
====================

Provides a Zeek log writer implementation for the [NATS.io Connective Technology](https://nats.io/)
[JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) persistence system.

Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

This plugin has a build dependency on the `libnats-dev` package on a Debian-like system.

```bash
$ apt-get update && apt-get install libnats-dev
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
```


Testing
-------

After compiling and installing the plugin, verify Zeek is able to load the plugin:

```bash
$ zeek -NN Zeek::NATS
Zeek::NATS - Log writer sending to NATS (dynamic, version 0.0.6)
    [Writer] NATS (Log::WRITER_NATS)
```

Testing against a locally running NATS server can be done as follows:

Start a NATS server in one terminal, by default it'll listen on port 4222 which
is also used in the plugin by default.
```bash
$ nats-server -js
```

Change the `Log::default_writer` of Zeek to `Log::WRITER_NATS` and listen on an interface:

```bash
$ zeek -C -i lo Log::default_writer=Log::WRITER_NATS
```

In yet another terminal, subscribe to the default subject used by the plugin,
using the `nats` CLI. This will show all logs produced by the Zeek instance.
```bash
$ nats subscribe 'sensor.logs.*'
17:51:56 Subscribing on sensor.logs.*
