  * Write: Use multiple streams by default, make configurable (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    This is a bit of a mess, but the new test should show how to
    switch into single stream mode.

    It's overly configurable, but essentially supports single stream
    with a wildcard subject on the stream, or individual streams
    where the publish subject should agree with the stream subject.

  * Writer: Do not use zeek::Reporter calls (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

    These aren't actually safe to be called from logging threads. Oh my.

  * testing: Run basic integration test in container (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

  * DoFinish: Wait for outstanding publishes during DoFinish (Arne Welzel, Corelight)

  * DoWrite: Make publish asynchronous (Arne Welzel, Corelight)
